# Macro Mixer - Hardware
A protective case which prevents esd, finger oils and dust from entering the pcb. The case also serves as great aesthetics. 8 Screws at M2 at 10mm screw length that sandwich the Top-PCB-Bottom stack. You have to put the switches in after assembling the hardware case as the case is designed for switches to sit ontop whilst being held by the Kalih Hotswappable Connectors.
